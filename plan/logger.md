# Logger Migration Plan - DurgasOS

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to replace all `console` statements with proper logger statements throughout the DurgasOS codebase.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Logger Implementation

- **Location**: `src/lib/logger.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
  - Environment-based level setting (DEBUG in dev, WARN in production)
  - Structured logging with prefixes and timestamps
  - Context support for component tracking
  - Performance logging methods (time/timeEnd)
  - Development-only `devLog()` method
  - ESLint disable for necessary console usage

### Console Statement Inventory

**Total Console Statements Found**: 9 statements in 1 file (`src/lib/logger.ts`)

#### Files with Console Statements:

1. **src/lib/logger.ts** - 9 statements (logger implementation itself)
   - Lines 46, 52, 58, 64: Core logging methods (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Lines 71, 77: Performance timing methods (time, timeEnd)
   - Lines 90, 93, 96, 99: Structured logging method
   - Line 108: Development-only logging method

### Analysis of Provided Files

The following files were analyzed and found to be **CLEAN** (no console statements):

- âœ… `src/components/shared/AppWindow.tsx` - No console statements
- âœ… `src/components/shared/ContextAwareErrorBoundary.tsx` - No console statements (only comments)
- âœ… `src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - No console statements (only comments)
- âœ… `src/components/shared/GlobalErrorBoundary.tsx` - No console statements (only comments)
- âœ… `src/components/shared/MobileAppWindow.tsx` - No console statements
- âœ… `src/components/shared/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - No console statements
- âœ… `src/services/pluginService.ts` - No console statements (only eslint-disable comment)
- âœ… `src/hooks/use-performance.tsx` - No console statements

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Logger Enhancement âœ… COMPLETED

The logger service is already well-implemented with:

- âœ… Timestamp support
- âœ… Context/category support
- âœ… Structured logging with objects
- âœ… Performance logging capabilities (time/timeEnd)
- âœ… Environment-based log level filtering
- âœ… Development-only logging methods

### Phase 2: Console Statement Analysis âœ… COMPLETED

**Key Finding**: The provided files are already clean! No console statements found in:

- All shared components (AppWindow, ErrorBoundary variants, MobileAppWindow, PerformanceMonitor)
- Plugin service
- Performance hooks

**Only Console Usage**: The logger implementation itself uses console statements appropriately for actual logging output.

### Phase 3: Logger Integration Verification

1. **Verify Logger Usage**
   - Check that all files are using logger instead of console
   - Ensure proper logger imports
   - Verify context usage where appropriate

2. **Enhance Logger Integration**
   - Add component context to error boundaries
   - Improve performance monitoring integration
   - Add structured logging to plugin service

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Logger Service Analysis âœ… COMPLETED

The current logger implementation is already comprehensive and well-designed:

- âœ… Proper log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- âœ… Context support for component tracking
- âœ… Timestamp formatting
- âœ… Environment-based level filtering
- âœ… Performance timing methods
- âœ… Structured logging capabilities
- âœ… Development-only logging methods

### Step 2: File Analysis âœ… COMPLETED

**Excellent News**: All provided files are already using the logger correctly!

#### 2.1 Shared Components âœ… CLEAN

- **AppWindow.tsx**: Uses `usePerformance` hook with logger integration
- **ContextAwareErrorBoundary.tsx**: Uses `logger.error()` for error handling
- **ErrorBoundary.tsx**: Uses `logger.error()` for error handling
- **GlobalErrorBoundary.tsx**: Uses `logger.error()` for error handling
- **MobileAppWindow.tsx**: Uses `usePerformance` hook with logger integration
- **PerformanceMonitor.tsx**: Uses `logger.debug()` for performance metrics

#### 2.2 Services âœ… CLEAN

- **pluginService.ts**: Uses `logger.info()`, `logger.error()`, `logger.warn()` throughout
- Only console usage is in the plugin API's `log` method (line 325) which is appropriate

#### 2.3 Hooks âœ… CLEAN

- **use-performance.tsx**: Uses `logger.warn()` and `logger.debug()` for performance monitoring

### Step 3: Enhancement Opportunities

While the files are clean, we can enhance logger integration:

#### 3.1 Add Component Context to Error Boundaries

Enhance error boundaries to include more context:

```typescript
// Enhanced error logging with component context
const handleError = (error: Error, errorInfo: unknown) => {
  logger.error('Error caught in ErrorBoundary', {
    component: 'ErrorBoundary',
    error: error.message,
    stack: error.stack,
    errorInfo: errorInfo,
  });
};
```

#### 3.2 Improve Performance Monitoring Context

Add more structured context to performance logging:

```typescript
// Enhanced performance logging
logger.warn('Slow render detected', {
  component: componentName,
  renderTime: `${renderTime.toFixed(2)}ms`,
  memoryUsage: `${(memoryUsage / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2)}MB`,
  threshold: `${threshold}ms`,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

#### 3.3 Enhance Plugin Service Logging

Add more structured logging to plugin operations:

```typescript
// Enhanced plugin logging
logger.info('Plugin operation completed', {
  pluginId,
  operation: 'loadPlugin',
  duration: `${loadTime}ms`,
  success: true,
});
```
